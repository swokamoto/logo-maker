# LOGO MAKER
This Node.js command-line application generates a logo based on user input and saves it as an SVG file. Users are prompted to select a color, choose a shape, and provide text for the logo. The application then creates the logo with the specified parameters and saves it to a .svg file. This tool is ideal for quickly creating simple, customized logos in SVG format.
